Scripts for managing the TIFLIC DIY Book scanner project on OS X

Here is the [original post on DIY Book Scanner forum](https://forum.diybookscanner.org/download/file.php?id=5491) that prompted me to build this project.

To read my notes about how I built my version of Mohib's scanner, [here is my blog post](http://evilgeniuschronicles.org/2018/09/25/my-build-of-the-tiflic-diy-bookscanner/) with my links and description of how I use these scripts.
